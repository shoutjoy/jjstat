\title{HTMT for Multilevel SEM}
\usage{
htmt_mlsem(fit, level = c("within", "between"), digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A lavaan object fitted with a multilevel CFA/SEM model.}

\item{level}{Character. One of \code{"within"} or \code{"between"}.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of digits to round the HTMT values.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the HTMT matrix
(lower triangle only; diagonal and upper triangle are NA).
}
\description{
This function computes the Heterotrait–Monotrait ratio (HTMT)
for multilevel CFA/SEM models estimated using lavaan.
HTMT is calculated separately for within-level or between-level
measurement models based on observed-variable correlations.
}
\details{
HTMT is defined as the ratio of the mean of heterotrait–heteromethod
correlations to the geometric mean of monotrait–heteromethod
correlations.

Only latent variables with at least two indicators are included.
The function uses level-specific observed-variable correlation
matrices extracted via \code{lavInspect(fit, "cor.ov")}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
fit <- lavaan::sem(model, data = Demo.twolevel, cluster = "cluster")

mlsem_htmt(fit, level = "within")
mlsem_htmt(fit, level = "between")
}
