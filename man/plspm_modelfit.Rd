\title{Calculate Model Fit Indices for PLS Models}
\usage{
plspm_modelfit(
  pls_model,
  blocks,
  bootstrap = 1000,
  ci = 0.95,
  digits = 5,
  trans = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pls_model}{A PLS model object containing model results.}

\item{blocks}{A list defining the measurement model blocks. Each block should contain variable names.}

\item{bootstrap}{The number of bootstrap samples to use. Default is 1000.}

\item{ci}{The confidence level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{digits}{The number of decimal places to round results. Default is 5.}

\item{trans}{If TRUE, transforms the result into a transposed data frame. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the computed fit indices and their evaluations.
}
\description{
This function computes various model fit indices for a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model, including SRMR, NFI, d_ULS, and d_G.
Bootstrap confidence intervals for d_ULS and d_G are also provided.
