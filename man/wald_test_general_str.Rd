\title{Wald Test for Hypotheses Specified as Strings}
\usage{
wald_test_general_str(
  model,
  hypothesis,
  rhs = 0,
  test = c("F", "Chisq"),
  vcov_func = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, such as an object from `lm` or `glm`.}

\item{hypothesis}{A character string representing the hypothesis to test.
For example, `"x1 - x2 + x3 = 0"`. The right-hand side (`rhs`) is
automatically incorporated into the hypothesis.}

\item{rhs}{A numeric value for the right-hand side of the hypothesis equation.
Default is `0`.}

\item{test}{A character string specifying the type of test to perform. Options
are `"F"` (default) or `"Chisq"`.}

\item{vcov_func}{An optional function for specifying a custom covariance matrix.
Default is `NULL`, in which case the model's default covariance matrix is used.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
  - `var_comparison`: A standardized version of the hypothesis in text form.
  - `W`: The Wald statistic.
  - `df`: Degrees of freedom for the test.
  - `p_value`: The p-value associated with the test.
  - `method`: The type of test performed (`"F"` or `"Chisq"`).
  - `mat`: A vectorized representation of the hypothesis matrix.
}
\description{
This function performs a Wald test for general linear hypotheses on a fitted model.
The hypothesis is specified as a string (e.g., `"x1 - x2 + x3 = 0"`) and is converted
into a matrix internally for computation. This allows for flexible specification of
hypotheses in an intuitive text-based format.

\examples{
# Example: Linear model with Wald test
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(100), x2 = rnorm(100), x3 = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data)

# Perform Wald test with text-based hypothesis
result <- wald_test_general_str(model, "x1 - x2 + x3 = 0", test = "F")
print(result)
