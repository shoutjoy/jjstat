\title{Multilevel SEM Reliability (Cronbach's alpha, CR, AVE)}
\usage{
mlsem_reliability(fit, level = c("within", "between"), digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted lavaan multilevel SEM object.}

\item{level}{Character. One of \code{"within"} or \code{"between"}.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of digits to round the results.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with latent variables and their reliability indices:
\describe{
  \item{Latent}{Latent variable name}
  \item{Cronbach}{Cronbach's alpha}
  \item{CR}{Composite Reliability}
  \item{AVE}{Average Variance Extracted}
}
}
\description{
This function computes reliability indices for multilevel SEM models
fitted with lavaan. Reliability is calculated separately for within-
and between-level measurement models.
}
\details{
The function returns Cronbach's alpha (model-based, using observed
correlation matrix), Composite Reliability (CR), and Average Variance
Extracted (AVE) based on standardized factor loadings.


\itemize{
  \item Cronbach's alpha is computed using the model-implied observed
  correlation matrix (lavInspect(fit, "cor.ov")).
  \item CR and AVE are computed from standardized factor loadings.
  \item Latent variables with fewer than two indicators are excluded.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- '
level: 1
  fw =~ y1 + y2 + y3

level: 2
  fb =~ y1 + y2 + y3
'

fit <- lavaan::sem(
  model,
  data    = Demo.twolevel,
  cluster = "cluster"
)

mlsem_reliability(fit, level = "within")
mlsem_reliability(fit, level = "between", digits = 4)
}
